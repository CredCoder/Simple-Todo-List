# Simple Todo List

As I develop as a Web Developer, it has become apparent that like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, knowing and using GitHub is also essential. I plan to begin by adding this Simple Todo List project into my GitHub account. It is recommended that I add a README markdown file so here it is.

Objects, methods, functions, arrays, working with the DOM, and using JavaScript to add and modify HTML elements are some of the concepts used in this project. Other concepts like using and understanding the keyword `this` and iterating via the built-in `.forEach` method instead of using `for loops` that I began with. Trying to structure the JavaScript code such that it is well organized and easy to read. I did not include a lot comments as the JS code seems easy enough to follow. The one comment I did include includes this: "without this this, the this in `this.createDeleteBtn()` refers to the global window object". That's a bunch of the word this in one sentence. Anyway, my focus in this project has been on JavaScript but I plan to spend some time later improving the styling and adding some effects.
